    HTML: hyper text markup language
      <ul>
        <li> markup references tags (the things in arrow brackets) </li>
        <li> tags always have to be paired </li>
        <li> there is a structure to the document, everything is between start html and end html tags </li>
        <li> github workflow: make changes, save, commit, push (it might take a while to update site) </li>
        <li> whatever is commited to the repository should be working </li>
        <li> if you commit something and don't like it, you can go back to previous versions </li>
      </ul>
